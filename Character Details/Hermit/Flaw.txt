1. Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights
a little too much.

2. I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation
and meditation failed to quell.

3. I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.

4. I let my need to win arguments overshadow
friendships and harmony.

5. I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

6. I like keeping secrets and won't share them with
anyone.
