1 My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel
like the most wonderful and important person in the
world.

2. The common folk love me for my kindness and
generosity.

3. Noone could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that
I am a cut above the unwashed masses.

4. I take great pains to always look my best and follow the
latest fashions.

5. I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught
dead in unsuitable accommodations.

6. Despite mynoble birth, I do not place myself above
other folk. We all have the same blood.

7. My favor,once lost, is lost forever.

8. If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name,
and salt your fields.
