1. I have a family, but I have no idea where they are. One
day, I hope to see them again.

2. I worked the land, I love the land, and I will protect the
land.

3. A proud noble once gave me a horrible beating, and I
will take my revenge on any bully I encounter.

4. My tools are symbols of my pastlife, and I carry them
50 that I will never forget my roots.

5. I protect those who cannot protect themselves.

6. I wish my childhood sweetheart had come with me to
pursue my destiny.
