see me killed.

blind to my shortcomings and the risk of failure.

shameful secret, so I can never go home again.

4. I have a weakness for the vices of the city, especially
hard drink.

5. Secretly, I believe that things would be better if I were a
tyrant lording over the land.

6. I have trouble trusting in my allies.
