1. I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxieants.

2. There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.

3. I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent
resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.

4. Iam slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and
societies.

5. Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.

6. Don't expect me to save those who can't save
themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive
and the weak perish.
