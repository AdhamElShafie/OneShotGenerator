1. My town or city is my home, and I'll fight to defend it.

2. I sponsor an orphanage to keep others from enduring
what I was forced to endure.

3. I owe my survival to another urchin who taught me to
live on the streets.

4. I owe a debt I can never repay to the person who took
pity on me.

5. I escaped my life of poverty by robbing an important
person, and I'm wanted for it.

6. No one else should have to endure the hardships I've
been through.
