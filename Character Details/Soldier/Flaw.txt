1. The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear.
2. I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior.
3. I made a terrible mistake in battle cost many lives and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret.
4. My hatred of my enemies is blind and unreasoning.
5. I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.
6. I'd rather eat my armor than admit when I'm wrong.
