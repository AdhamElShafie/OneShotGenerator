1. I would still lay down my life for the people I
served with.

2. Someone saved my life on the battlefield. To this day, I
will never leave a friend behind.

3. My honor is my life.

4. I'll never forget the crushing defeat my company
suffered or the enemies who dealt it.

5. Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.

6. I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.
