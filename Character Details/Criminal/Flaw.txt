1. When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.
2. When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
3. If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.
4. I have a "tell" that reveals when I'm lying.
5. I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6. An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.
