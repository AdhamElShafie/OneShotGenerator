1. Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than
it was. (Good)

2. Tradition. the stories, legends, and songs of the past
must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we
are. (Lawful)

3. Creativity. the world is in need of new ideas and bold
action. (Chaotic)

4. Greed. I'm only in it for the money and fame. (Evil)

5. People. I like seeing the smiles on people's faces when
I perform. that's all that matters. (Neutral)

6. Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come
from within and reveal who we really are. (Any)
