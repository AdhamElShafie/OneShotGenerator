1. I'll do anything to win fame and renown.

2. I'm a sucker for a pretty face.

3. A scandal prevents me from ever going home again.
that kind of trouble seems to follow me around.

4. I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was
a mistake that I will likely repeal.

5. I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My
sharp tongue lands me in trouble.

6. Despile my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends.
