Good - Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. 
Lawful - Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. 
Chaotic - Freedom. The sea is freedom-Ihe freedom to go anywhere and do anything. 
Evil - Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. 
Neutral - People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals.
Any - Aspiration. Someday I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny.
