1. I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.
2. I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.
3. I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.
4. Everything I do is for the common people.
5. I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.
6. I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.
