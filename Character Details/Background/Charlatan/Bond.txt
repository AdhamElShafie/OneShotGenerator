1. I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about.
2. I owe everything to my mentor-a horrible person who's probably rotting in jail somewhere.
3. Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn't know me. I'm making the world better for him or her.
4. I come from a noble family, and one day I'll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me.
5. A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I'll have my revenge.
6 I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself.
