1. I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
2. I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
3. I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to.
4. I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
5. I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.
6. I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.
7. I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
8. I was, in fact, raised by wolves.
