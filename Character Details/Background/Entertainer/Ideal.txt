Good - Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. 
Lawful - Tradition. the stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are. 
Chaotic - Creativity. the world is in need of new ideas and bold action. 
Evil - Greed. I'm only in it for the money and fame. 
Neutral - People. I like seeing the smiles on people's faces when I perform. that's all that matters. 
Any - Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are.
