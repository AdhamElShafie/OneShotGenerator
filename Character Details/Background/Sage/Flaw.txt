1. I am easily distracted by the promise of information.
2. Most people scream and run when they see a demon. I stop and take notes on its anatomy.
3. Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilization.
4. I overlook obvious solutions in favor of complieated ones.
5. I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others.
6. I can't keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else's.
