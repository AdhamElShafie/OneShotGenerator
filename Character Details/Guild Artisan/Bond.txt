1. The workshop where I learned my trade is the most
important place in the world to me.

2. I created a great work for someone, and then found
them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for
someone worthy.

3. I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the
person I am today.

4. I pursue wealth to secure someone's love.

5. One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am
the greatest artisan of them all.

6. I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my
place of business and ruined my livelihood.
