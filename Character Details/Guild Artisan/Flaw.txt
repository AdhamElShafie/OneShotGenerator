1. I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or
priceless.

2. I'm quick to assume that someone Is trying to cheat
me.

3. No one must ever learn that I once stole money from
guild coffers.

4. I'm never satisfied with what I have-I always want
more.

5. I would kill to acquire a noble title.

6. I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my
handiwork. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivais.
