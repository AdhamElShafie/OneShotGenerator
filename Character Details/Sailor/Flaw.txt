1. I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong.

2. I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.

3. Once someone questions my courage, I never back
down no matter how dangerous the situation.

4. Once I slart drinking, it's hard for me to stop.

5. I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I
come across.

6. My pride will probably lead to my destruction.
