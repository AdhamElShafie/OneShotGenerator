1. I'm loyal to my captain first, everything else second.
2. The ship is most important-crewmates and captains come and go.
3. I'll always remember my first ship.
4. In a harbor I own, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.
5. I was cheated oul of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.
6. Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine.
