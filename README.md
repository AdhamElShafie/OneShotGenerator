# OneShotGenerator
## Created by The StrawHat Unicorns

##### The One Shot Generator has the ability to create one shot campaigns for a D&D group that are completely random each time around.
- Creates a list of character sheets that are each unique in their own ways
- Creates environments and dungeons for the DM to fill with their presence
- Creates a simple plot structure to drive the story forward until the DM has their footing in the adventure

###### The entire point of this is to improve your experience in improvising as a DM as well as giving your players a fun and hectic experience that's different every time!
###### As of right now, the OneShotGenerator only creates first level one shot campaigns.
